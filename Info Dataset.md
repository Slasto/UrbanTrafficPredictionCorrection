# Traffic Data **Australian Government data**
This dataset is provided by the [South Australian Government Data Directory](https://data.sa.gov.au/data/dataset/traffic-intersection-count) in `.csv` format

Data sourced from the traffic signal system (SCATS). The dataset contains the number of cars passing through a given intersection each hour within the Adelaide City Council jurisdiction, *related to 122 intersections*.

Traffic volume estimation is calculated every hour and the intersection location is identified by latitude and longitude, and the type of intersection is also present.
## Dataset Features
After searching online, the data schema used is for a **traffic intersection count** dataset.
- *site_no*: This is a unique identifier assigned to each intersection, enabling easy reference and differentiation.
- *site_desc*: This provides a brief description of the intersection, which could include details like street names, location landmarks, etc.
- *lat*: This represents the latitude coordinate of the intersection.
- *lon*: This represents the longitude coordinate of the intersection.
- *rec_date*: This indicates the date on which the traffic count was conducted at the intersection.
- *rec_hour*: This specifies the hour within the day for which the traffic count was recorded.
- *hourly_traffic*: This attribute holds the actual number of vehicles that passed through the intersection during the specified hour.
- *t_detector_counts*: This represents the total expected number of vehicles the system anticipated for the specific hour at the intersection, potentially based on historical data or other factors.
- *t_valid_counts*: This attribute indicates the total number of valid traffic counts recorded during the hour, excluding any potential errors or discrepancies.
- *t_error_counts*: This specifies the total number of identified errors or inconsistencies in the traffic count data for the specific hour.
- *error_ratio*: This is the calculated ratio between the number of errors and the number of valid counts, offering insight into the data quality and potential inaccuracies.
